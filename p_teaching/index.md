## Linear Algebra [5MA160](https://www.umu.se/utbildning/kursplan/5ma160/) 

This is a basic course in linear algebra aimed at first year students. We cover the usual elements of most linear algebra courses including solving systems of linear equations, manipulating matrices, computing eigenvalues, and working with the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. One goal of the course is to build geometric intuition in the students by studying vectors in 2 and 3 dimensional spaces so that they might better understand higher dimensional spaces. The course covers both abstract concepts such as the theory of general vector spaces as well as practical applications such as markov chains and networks. Students are evaluated by exams and a computer lab that requires the students to use MATLAB to apply their linear algebra knowledge.
* Text(s) and material: The primary text is *Elementary linear algebra: with supplemental applications 11th edition* by Anton Howard and Rorres Chris (ISBN: 9781118677452). Additional material is drawn from *Introduction to Linear Algebra 4th edition* by Gilbert Strang, *Linear Algebra 3rd edition* by Jim Hefferon, and videos by 3blue1brown on the [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/essence-of-linear-algebra-page)
* Computer labs: The [2018 version](/images/ComputerLab2018.pdf) had students model the rise of antibiotic resistance. The [2019 version](/images/ComputerLab2019.pdf) had students code Gaussian elimination solvers and compete in a tournament.
* Final exams: [2018 version](/images/Final2018.pdf) and [2019 version](/images/Final2019.pdf)

## Differential Equations for Engineers [5MA121](https://www.umu.se/utbildning/kursplan/5ma121/) 

This is a basic course in differential equations aimed at first year engineering students. 
The course covers the formulating and solving first and second order ordinary differential equations. Additional topics include nonlinear dynamics, the Laplace transform, Fourier series, and an introduction to solving partial differential equations. Emphasis is placed on teaching students different ways to model physical and biological systems with differential equations. Students are evaluated by exams and a computer lab that requires the students to use MATLAB to numerically solve differential equations.

* Text(s) and material: The primary text is *Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 11th edition* by William Boyce (ISBN: 978111938287). Additional material is drawn from *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* by Steven Strogatz and *Understanding Nonlinear Dynamics* by Daniel Kaplan and Leon Glass.
* Computer labs: The [2018 version](/images/DEComputerLab2018.pdf) had students solve Lotka-Volterra equations.
* Final exams: [2018 version](/images/DEFinal2018.pdf)
