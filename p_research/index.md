Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

### Multicellularity
Complex life has evolved through a series of major transitions in which existing individuals combine to become parts of a new kind of individual. One key transition was the evolution of multicellularity which made possible significant increases in organismal complexity. While multicellularity has evolved on dozens of independent occasions, these events occurred millions of years ago and are absent from the fossil record. Recent experiments, however, have made it possible to study this transition in the lab by using microorganisms to evolve primitive multicellularity <I> de novo </I>. An example of an experimental system that evolved multicellularity is the yeast <I> Saccharomyces cerevisiae <\I>.  Unicellular yeast were grown in liquid media and then subjected to selection for rapid settling by centrifugation. Cluster-forming "snowflake" yeast evolved readily and fixed in the population because they settled more quickly than their unicellular ancestors. Such experimental systems not only allow evolution to be viewed in action but provide excellent opportunities to test hypotheses about the conditions that govern major transitions and enable the evolution of additional forms of biological complexity.
