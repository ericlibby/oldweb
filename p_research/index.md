## Multicellularity
Complex life has evolved through a series of major transitions in which existing individuals combine to become parts of a new kind of individual. One key transition was the evolution of multicellularity which made possible significant increases in organismal complexity. While multicellularity has evolved on dozens of independent occasions, these events occurred millions of years ago and are absent from the fossil record. Recent experiments, however, have made it possible to study this transition in the lab by using microorganisms to evolve primitive multicellularity <I> de novo </I>. Such experimental systems provide excellent opportunities to test hypotheses about the conditions that govern major transitions and facilitate the evolution of additional forms of complexity. A major arc of my research is directed at understanding how multicellularity evolves and what happens following its initial appearance.

## Bet-hedging and Developmental programs

Many bacteria have evolved the capacity to switch between at least two phenotypic states. For instance, when grown in a lab <I>P. fluorescens</I> produces two phenotypes: "smooth" and "wrinkly". They differ by a mutation that causes wrinkly types to secrete an extracellular glue and stick together in a mat. In culture, smooth types give rise to wrinkly types who in turn will eventually produce smooth types. The dominant phenotype cycles because each phenotype modifies the environment to favor the other type. This coupling of environmental change to phenotypic change creates stable oscillations in phenotypes that select for a life-cycle between smooth (unicellular) and wrinkly (multicellular) states. We investigate how these simple, initially random switching events, can be beneficial as bet-hedging strategies and how they can evolve into more regulated forms of phenotypic expression as might be found in developmental programs.
