<b>Eric Libby (principle investigator) </b> Eric joined Ume&aring; University in the winter of 2017 and splits his time between the Mathematics Department and the interdisciplinary research environment IceLab. He is captivated by the diverse spectrum of life and seeks general principles/theory that explains how it arises and evolves. He also likes seafood.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

<p style="float: left;padding-right:25px"><img src="/images/hanna.jpg" width="120"></p> <b>Hanna Isaksson (PhD student) </b> Hanna started her PhD in Fall 2019. She is based at Icelab and the Ume&aring; University Mathematics Department. Her studies focus on understanding the evolution of multicellular life cycles and in particular how their early structure influences adaptation. She enjoys playing the organ and bird-watching among other things.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

<p style="float: left;padding-right:25px"><img src="/images/natalie.jpg" width="120"></p> <b>Natalie Grefenstette (postdoctoral researcher) </b> Natalie has always been fascinated in understanding the origins of life. Her fascination compelled her to study biochemistry at University College London and later to complete her PhD in prebiotic chemistry. She is interested in using her multidisciplinary background to help develop a deeper understanding of the organizing principles of biology and lifeâ€™s emergence on Earth and elsewhere. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
