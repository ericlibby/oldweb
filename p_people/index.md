### Eric Libby (principle investigator)
<p> Eric joined Ume&aring; University in the winter of 2017 and splits his time between the Mathematics Department and the interdisciplinary research environment IceLab. He is captivated by the diverse spectrum of life and seeks general principles and fundamental theory that explain its emergence and evolution. He also likes seafood. </p>

### Hanna Isaksson (PhD student) 
<p>Hanna started her PhD in Fall 2019. She is based at Icelab and the Ume&aring; University Mathematics Department. Her studies focus on understanding the evolution of multicellular life cycles and in particular how their early structure influences adaptation. She enjoys playing the organ and bird-watching among other things. </p>

### Natalie Grefenstette (postdoctoral researcher) 
<p>Natalie has always been fascinated in understanding the origins of life. Her fascination led her to study biochemistry at University College London and earn a PhD in prebiotic chemistry. She wants to use her multidisciplinary background to identify the organizing principles of biology and the emergence of life on Earth and elsewhere. </p>
