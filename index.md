My research focuses on the evolution of biological complexity-- particularly the origins of multicellularity, life cycles, development, cooperation, and organizational scales. Essentially, I am interested in how simple organisms evolve into complex ones. This topic is fundamental to understanding the evolution and ecology of life on earth and in the universe.
