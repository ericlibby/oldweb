My research focuses on the evolution of biological complexity-- particularly the origins of multicellularity, life cycles, syntrophy, and organizational scales. Essentially, I am interested in how simple organisms evolve into complex ones. This topic is not only fascinating but it is fundamental to understanding the evolution and ecology of life-- both on earth and elsewhere in the "verse".

- 1/13/21: After neglecting this website for a while, I am happy to announce that I am hiring two postdocs to model microbial evolution for projects entitled "Predicting the coevolutionary trajectories of simple microbial communities" and "A theoretical framework for the evolution of beneficial endosymbioses". Please contact me if you have any questions. You can apply for the first project [here](https://www.umu.se/en/work-with-us/postdoctoral-scholarships/6-2732-21) and the second one [here](https://www.umu.se/en/work-with-us/postdoctoral-scholarships/6-26-22).


- 9/2/19: It has been a busy summer: two conferences (AbSciCon and the GRC Microbial Population Biology), two new publications (the emergence of [syntrophy](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007169) and a [news and views](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0956-5) piece), and most importantly a new PhD student Hanna Isaksson! Hanna's PhD will focus on the evolution of multicellular life cycles. We are very excited to have her join us at Icelab!

- 5/09/19: I will be speaking at the Workshop on Modelling in Biology and Medicine (MBM) in Gothenburg. It will be a fun meeting!
