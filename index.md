My research focuses on the evolution of biological complexity-- particularly the origins of multicellularity, life cycles, syntrophy, and organizational scales. Essentially, I am interested in how simple organisms evolve into complex ones. This topic is not only fascinating but it is fundamental to understanding the evolution and ecology of life-- both on earth and elsewhere in the "verse".
