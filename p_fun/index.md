### March 25, 2016: Kombu no tsukudani 
Through random encounters with this preserved algae dish, I learned that translucent brown-green squares equals deliciousness. The problem was that I could not find any in my local grocery store. This is completely understandable though as the nearest ocean 1000 km away and the local cuisine follows more of the green chile and corn tortilla persuasion. Wondering if I could make it myself, I found a recipe for [kombu no tsukudani](http://justbento.com/handbook/johbisai/homemade-shio-kombu-kombu-no-tsukudani) that used ingredients available in Santa Fe (including the kombu). My first attempt at making this dish was also an attempt to impress family. I impressed upon them that I could make rubbery algae that exhausted their jaw muscles. Tasting the potential, I tried again and found much greater success. Although this is by no means authentic to discerning palates, it made me happy. I used the same recipe as before but let the vinegar work its magic for three times longer. I also found that with enough sake, kombu-- like people-- eventually breaks down into something far less rigid. In the end, my little jar of success will probably find its way into various rice-based dishes. Because of its deliciousness, its lifespan will be short-- short and glorious.
