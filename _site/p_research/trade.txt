Multicellularity is a broad term that encapsulates many different forms. For example, animals are composed of genetically homogeneous cells and are essentially multicellular their entire life while <I> Dictyostelium discoideum </I> oscillates between single-celled and multi-celled life stages and may produce multicellular bodies composed of many different genomes. And yet, there are more unusual examples in which cells fuse together like fungal hyphae or completely different species develop functional dependencies as occurs in microbial communities that share metabolites. Although these different living arrangements may fall under the umbrella of multicellularity they create different opportunities for the evolution of further complexity. I am particularly interested in contrasting metabolite-trading microbial communities with more traditional forms of multicellularity. 

Andreas Wagner (U. of Zurich), John Miller (Carnegie Mellon) and Laurent Hebert-Dufresne (SFI), and I are investigating metabolite-trading microbial communities. We are evolving metabolic networks of different sized consortia {\it in silico} and permitting organisms to exchange metabolites amongst themselves. With this data, we will use network analysis techniques, flux balance analysis, and economic theory to explore how division of labor, trade, and functional integration emerge in microbial metabolic networks. We can then exchange consortia members as might occur in the normal dynamics of biofilms and microbiomes and test for robustness and community structure.
